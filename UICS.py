# WARNING: Complete the parts and steps in order. Don’t create any commits unless the instructions explicitly ask that you do so. Grading will fail if there are any extraneous commits.
# NOTE: All strings and commit messages are case- and whitespace-sensitive, though trailing whitespace is stripped from commit messages when grading. Don’t include quotation marks.

# PARTS 1–5
# See `Code.py`…

# PART 6
# 1. Check out the “main” branch.
# 2. Create a new branch named “part6-fullname” and check it out.
# 3. Modify `full_name()` in `Course` such that it returns a string of the form `"[code]-[number] [name]"`, where “`[code]`” is the course code (`self.code`), “`[number]`” is the course number (`self.number`), and “`[name]`” is the course name (`self.name`).
# 4. Commit the change.
# 5. Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
# 6. Check out the “main” branch.
# 7. Create a new branch named “part6-conflict” and check it out.
# 8. Fix `conflict()` in `Course` such that it correctly takes into account the days on which specific courses take place.
# 	- Two courses that don’t take place on any of the same days of the week can’t possibly conflict.
# 9. Commit the change.
# 10. Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
# 11. Check out the “main” branch.
# 12. Add a function `hours()` in `Course` that returns the total number of hours per week that are scheduled for a course as an integer, rounded up to the next whole number.
# 	- Python’s `time` and `timedelta` classes might be useful. They have already been imported for you.
# 	- Python’s `ceil()` function might also be useful. It, too, has already been imported for you.
# 	- There are 3,600 seconds in an hour.
# 	- You can assume that all properties of the `time` class besides `hour` and `minute` are `0`.
# 13. Commit the change.
# 14. Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
# 15. Check out the “part6-conflict” branch.
# 16. Merge the “part6-fullname” branch into the “part6-conflict” branch.
# 17. Modify `test_conflict()` such that it compares two courses that do indeed conflict with each other.
# 	- You may create helper functions if you want to do so.
# 18. Commit the change.
# 19. Push the commits to your private GitHub repository.
# 20. Check out “part6-conflict” branch.
# 21. Rebase the “part6-conflict” on the “main” branch, resolving the merge conflicts as you do so.
# 	- Make sure to preserve the changes that you made in both branches.
# 22. Push the commits to your private GitHub repository.
# 23. Check out the “main” branch.
# 24. Fast-forward the “main” branch to the new state of the “part6-conflict” branch.
# 25. Push the commits to your private GitHub repository.
